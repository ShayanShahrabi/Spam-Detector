## Introduction
A simple **Bayes classifier** is a group of probabilistic classifiers that usually have acceptable accuracy. This method is based on **independent events** and **Bayes theorem**. 

## How the code works?
This program is an implementation of the technique mentioned above. So through analyzing SMS data with spam and non-spam labels (which is provided in the `train_data.txt` file), it will predict whether each SMS provided in the `sample_test_data.txt` file is spam or not.
